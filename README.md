# Algorithmic Bioinformatics

This project aims on making the algorithms covered in the corresponding lecture at LMU Munich easier to understand by providing step-by-step logging and result visualization.

## Usage

### GitHub CodeSpaces
You can run the scripts without installing anything on your computer by clicking at the green "Code" button in the top right corner, then on the tab "Codespaces" and then "Create new Codespace". 

### Docker
This repository provides a convenient way to use a VS Code development container. To get started, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [VS Code Remote - Containers](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

Once you have these dependencies installed, you can open the repository in VS Code and click the green button in the bottom left corner. This action will launch the repository within a Docker container that includes all the necessary dependencies.

### Prefer a manual approach? No problem!
If you are using Linux, you can simply run the `setup.sh` script. For other operating systems, you can examine the script to determine the dependencies and install them manually.
